           <h4 > What is a privacy policy?</h4>
             <br />
           <p>A privacy policy is a legal document where you disclose what data you collect from users, how you manage the collected data and how you use that data. The important objective of a privacy policy is to inform users how you collect, use and manage the collected.</p>
             <br />
           <h4>Why is a privacy policy important? </h4>
              <br />
            <p>The most important thing to remember is that a privacy policy is required by law if you collect data from users, either directly or indirectly. For example, if you have a contact form on your website you need a privacy policy. But you will also need a privacy policy if you use analytics tools such as Google Analytics.</p>  
              <br />
            <h4>Where do I put my privacy policy?</h4>  
              <br />
            <p>A standard privacy policy should include: what data you collect from visitors, how you collect it, why you are collecting the data, how you are using the data.</p>
