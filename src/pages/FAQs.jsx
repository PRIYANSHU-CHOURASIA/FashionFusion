      <div class="answer">
        <p>Online payments are monitored by our systems for any suspicious activity and some transactions are verified through extensive checks if we find that they are not authorised by the owner of the card. When we're not able to rule fraud out in rare cases, the transaction is kept on hold and we ask the shopper to share relevant proofs. This is done to make sure that the transaction is genuine and authorised.</p>
